1. Determine start player
1. Initial boat placement
1. Race
    1. Last player need not cross the line.
1. Score championship points
1. Assign credits

# Race Format
Roll **2d3** and consult following table

roll | format | layout
---|----------|----
2 | Point to point | Any configuration, preferably U shaped so players can reach most of the course easily. Requires separate start and finish lines. Use all three buoys as normal to direct the race.
3,4,5 | Lake | Traditional 2x3 grid
6 | Doughnut | Similar to lake but with a gap in the centre of the board created by offsetting tiles


# Special Conditions
Often some special condition on the water will make it more challenging for the pilots. Roll **2d3** and consult the following table

roll | condition | effect
---|----------|----
2 | Floe | Use damage counters as icebergs. Determine floe direction as for cross wind. Each turn, every iceberg moves once in the direction
3 | Cross wind | Roll a d6 to determine the direction the wind comes FROM. Assign 1 to the edge of the board at which the black player sits, 2 to the next hex edge, and so on. The wind blows from this direction for the entire race, and pushes your boat one space in that direction after each go.
4 | No special condition | 
5 | Seaweed | Dense thickets of seaweed snare your propellor. Every go, subtract 1 from your movement distance after summing your dice
6 | Mangrove | The shallow waters and tree roots mean your rudder and keel can't be as deep, resulting in a drifting action when turning. Turning can still be done only once per turn, and only by one hex edge, but the turn doesn't happen before moving. Instead, turning happens after the boat has moved a number of spaces equal to the number of dice used.

# Award Championship Points
## Standard points
Consult the following table to determine standard points for the race.

Num. players | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 |
-------------|---|---|---|---|
First        | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 |
Second       | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
Third        | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
Fourth       | 2 | 1 | 0 | - |
Fifth        | 1 | 0 | - | - |
Sixth        | 0 | - | - | - |

## Bonus points
A single bonus point is earned for each of the following:
* Most hexes moved in a single turn (in the case of special movement, simply count the hexes between start point and finish point).
    * In case of a tie, the first player to accomplish this feat earns the bonus point.

# Earn credits ("cr.")
All players earn 3 credits for completing a race. In addition, players earn bonus credits for achieving the following:
* Most hexes moved in a single turn (as above).
* First player to cross the finish line.
* First player to come within two hexes of a buoy. A bonus credit is earned for each buoy in the race. A player does not have to end their go within the distance, merely travel through any of those hexes.

No player may earn more than five credits each race! Any subsequent credits earned by this player are lost and not earned by anybody else.


# Upgrades
Between races, you can spend credits (or "cr.") to add upgrades to your boat. You can buy any number of upgrades, as long as you can afford them.

## Consumables
* Repair (1 cr.)
    * Remove a single damage marker from your boat.
* Nitro (1 cr.)
    * May spend one Nitro per turn after moving (but before effects of wind, etc.) to move one additional hex in the direction you just moved.
    * May spend two Nitro in one turn to go airborne for one hex during your movement. Ignore land, boats, etc.. This does not add to your movement this turn. **You cannot jump over buoys**.
* Anchor (2 cr.)
    * May be spent when turning to turn an additional 60 degrees, so your boat faces two hex edges away from where it began.

## Permanents
* Ram (a.k.a. "The Bonta") (2 cr.)
    * When colliding with another boat, instead of stopping on the hex behind them, you stop on their hex and push them once space forward.
    * If pushing them would result in them ending up in anything other than open water (land, buouy, other boat, hazard, etc.), then your ram has no effect during this collision.
* Low drag rudder (3 cr.)
    * If you don't turn this go, you **must** add 1 to your dice sum.
* Double rudder (3 cr.)
    * Instead of turning before you move, you may turn after moving forward a single hex, then complete the rest of your movement.
* Bow thrusters (2 cr.)
    * Instead of turning, before moving, spend one Nitro (instead of any other use of Nitro this go!) to slide your boat sideways into the forward-left or forward-right hex
* Remote pilot (4 cr.)
    * Your pilot sits comfortably on a tower overlooking the race. His will for self-preservation is still intact, but his fate is no longer tied to that of his boat. You may now choose to ignore the rules about avoiding collisions when possible. However because your pilot's feedback isn't as immediate as others', you are slow off the start line. You don't move on the first round of the race, however you may still roll and keep the result, and add/remove/keep dice on your second go.
